# Why do I need Visual Studio Code and Markdown?

**Visual Studio Code** and **Markdown** are the tools for easy and quick creating and publishing documentation.

Various popular formats, such as PDF, HTML, WORD, are used for this purpose, but they have some limitations.

PDF - [see for more details](./pdf.md)  
HTML - [see for more details](./html.md)  
WORD - [see for more details](./word)  

Most of the limitations are not present in **Markdown**. The tool allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it, for example, to structurally valid XHTML or HTML.  
* The standard for quick documentation in IT and related fields  
* The format is simple and readable without editing  
* Documentation can be expanded to any size  
* It is easy to manage a large number of documents and reuse of content  
* A free tool with preview  
* Visual issues are separated from the content
* Other input and output formats can be generated from .md file
* The file can be modified or content can be extracted from it
* A simple tool for simple things, but more difficult for complex things (e.g. tables, formulas)
* It is a text format, so when moving between environments, you have to remember about the end of line character and character encoding

**Visual Studio Code** is a source code editor which is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.
* VSC supports and facilitates documentation writing
* It shows the output preview while typing
* It works with Git tool
* VSC is free and widely used
