# How to managing branches?
Branches isolate the development work from other branches in the repository. You always create a branch from an existing branch. Usually, you might create a branch from the default branch of your repository. You can then work on this new branch in isolation from changes that other people are making to the repository.

## How to create a branch?
1. At the top of the app, click **Current Branch** and then in the list of branches, click the branch that you want to base your new branch on.

3. Under **Name**, type the name of the new branch.

4. Use the drop-down to choose a base branch for your new branch (e.g. **master**)
5. Click **Create Branch**.
6. Publish the created branch. You'll need to publish the branch to make it available for collaboration on GitHub. At the top of the app, click **Current Branch**, then click the branch that you want to publish.
