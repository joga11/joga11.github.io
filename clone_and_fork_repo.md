# How to clone and fork repositories?

You can use GitHub Desktop to clone or fork repositories from GitHub Desktop (local repositories).  
You can also clone repository from GitHub to GitHub Desktop (remote repositories).  
By **cloning** a repository, you can create a local copy of any repository on GitHub that you have access to.  
If the repo is cloned, any changes you push to GitHub will affect the original repository. So, to make changes without affecting the original project, you can create a separate copy by **forking** the repository. A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage.
