# WORD
**WORD** is a widely available and familiar format. It allows simple formatting and other input and output formats can be generated. You can modify the .docx file or extract the content. However, the format is not good for large documents. It's difficult to manage a large number of documents and reuse content. It's difficult to separate visual issues from the content. Collaboration between authors and other content consumers is difficult.
